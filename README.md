# Automatic-Gas-booking-and-Gas-Leakage-Detection
	This is based on ATMega16A microcontroller.
	We are using MQ-6 Gas sensor and Load cell for Weight Measurement.
	A cost effective, automatic Liquefied Petroleum Gas(LPG) booking, leakage detection and real time gas monitoring system 
	the LPG leakage it detected through the sensor and information is sent to the user by short message service(SMS) and simultaneously alerts the customer using a GSM module 
	it continuously monitors the level of the LPG present in the cylinder using weight sensor and automatically books the cylinder using a GSM Module.
